# Prasunet-CyberSecurity-Internship
Welcome to my Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio! 
This repository features a collection of five cybersecurity projects I've developed. Each project highlights different security practices,
from encryption methods to network traffic analysis. Dive into the code and insights of each project to see how they contribute to enhancing digital security.

Included Projects:
1. Pixel Manipulation: Explores steganography by embedding information within images.
2. Caesar Cipher: Implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption method.
3. Password Complexity Checker: Evaluates and improves password strength.
4. Key Logger : Monitors keystrokes through a keylogging application (for educational purposes).
5. Network Packet Analyzer: Examines network traffic to detect securityÂ threats
